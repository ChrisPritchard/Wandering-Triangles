# 'Wandering Triangles' Background Animination

A script for overlaying a canvas (ideally one set to stand behind the body of a page) with falling geometric triangles that 'wander' in a downwards direction.

Inspired by some of the art work for Deus Ex Human Revolution, and later Mankind Divided, which features triangular patterns in gold.

Below is a sample of how it looks. The three basic overrides are background colour, primary colour (most triangles) and secondary colour (some triangles). In the sample these colours are black, gold and grey.

There are further settings that can be overriden, such as speed, interval, count etc. The sample overrides the last, changing the default 20 triangles to 50. Other settings can be found by examining the BackgroundAnimation.ts file.
